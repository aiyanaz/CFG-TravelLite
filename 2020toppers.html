    <H1><u>Our Top 2020 Toppers</u></H1>
    <p> Above we have our most voted for popular destinations within Europe. All just a short distance from eachother and all using efficient if not sustainable means to travel there. Check them out and see if these could be on the list for your next trip?
    <br>
    <br>Coming in at No. 10, we have Rome. Notoriously already a popular city however this came in at number 10 not only for it's historical architecture but also for it's eco-friendly values. In particular for it's Zeromission event which is dedicated to promoting renewable energies in the Mediterranean area.
    <br>
    <br>Number 9 is Germany, being listed not only from it's stunning architectural views but for it being a notorious Nature Haven for visitors too. From the Berlin Wall to a more countryside based retreat in their Ultimate Fairytale Castle.
    <br> 
    <br>Both 7 & 8 are notorious for being the new cities of romance, with Seville sparking the views and Lisbon providing the architectural feels. Both equally easy to get to from London, with a short plane ride or Eurostar train away.
    <br> 
    <br>Not forgetting the Beautiful Belgium at a strong number 6, sustainability is a key factor for them. Take a walking tour of the city or discover the endless farming possibilities on one of their rooftop farms (yes, I did say rooftop).
    <br> 
    <br>Treat yourself to a new way of life in Amsterdam where you can cycle to your hearts content. Everything you need in the city centre is a short walk away if not a short tram ride away. Sustainable, yes - peaceful? Doubly yes. 
    <br>
    <br>Coming close at number 4, we have Madrid. Local, hot and easily one of our favourite cities thus far. Full of the new generation, green hotels, Madrid is making it's best efforts to give back to the world. Why not visit their infamous botanical garden or take a tour of the mountains on the Cable Car of Madrid?

<h1 style="align-items: center;"> &nbsp; </h1> 

<H1 style="align-items: center;"><u>#3 Marseille</u></H1>

<div class="Marseilletext">
    <p>Known infamously for it's historical culture, Marseille hits our list in 3<sup>rd</sup> place on our list for a number of different reasons. A 6-hour Eurostar ride from London, Marseille has one of the most sustainable means of travel for Londoners.  
    <br> 
    <br> A popular spot in Marseille would be the The Calanques National Park which was created in May 2012. In it's short time of existence, The Calanques became Europeâ€™s largest National Park which emcompasses the sea, land and peri-urban areas. Thanks to this classification the 5000 hectare massif benefits from added protection to Marseille. This is definitely on our list of things to explore there especially for it's fresh air and breathtaking views. The level of scenery contained within this beautiful place is eyecatching for visitors who love hikes and landscapes. sightseeing and hikes which are all truly unique. A journey through the Calanques massif is a path of discovery through breathtaking landscapes, a coastline where urban life is never far away, but where the wild and secret coves alternate with nature trails that offer many wonderful walks.
    <br>
    <br> If you don't quite fancy a coastal walk, take a trip into the city where you'll be spoilt for choice. The city of Marseille is rich in both food and culture so there's plenty to do witht things stemming from riding around the city on their newly installed bikes. The beautiful climate allows ourists to glide around the city whilst helping to protect the environment or if you fancy being driven about, hop on their eco-friendly ferry! </p>
</div>

<H1 style="align-items: center;"><u>#2 Barcelona</u></H1>

<div class="barcelonatext">
    <p>Barcelona is that city break that doesn't quite feel like a city break, always more of a summer holiday! Notorious for it's favoursome weather, Barcelona is known well for it's architecture spanning throughout the decades. There is a rich presence of greenery with natural spaces and beaches making the city of Barcelona a city with amazing environmental quality. Barcelona also has an amazing air quality meaning that the notorious blue sky is all year round thanks to it's endless suppy of oxygen from their number of holistic gardens. 
    <br>
    <br> If all of that walking around hasn't built your appetite up, I'm sure a trip to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g187497-d3732573-Reviews-SUMMUM_Nightbar-Barcelona_Catalonia.html">Summum restaurant</a> at the 4-star <a target="_blank" href="https://alimarahotel.com/en/"> Hotel Alimara</a> is an especially good option for both the pallet and the environment. Not only does it have excellent Catalan cuisine (with our reccomendation being the squid and sausage â€˜surf and turfâ€™) but itâ€™s committment to to social projects is exceptional. Some of these projects include working with UNICEF and the Food Banks, amongst so many others. When you visit here, you're also giving back to the community of Barcelona as any leftover food is vacuum packed and distributed it to Barcelona Shares Food</a>, who are dedicated to reducing waste and poverty nationally.           
         </p>

<H1 style="align-items: center;"><u>#1 Paris</u></H1>
    
<div class="paristext">
    <p> Topping our list at number one has to be the infamous city of love, Paris is the most eco-friendly location with an evergrowing number of environmentally friendly food places, sustainable intercity transport links and eco-conscious stores. Over the past years, there's been a huge increase in efforts to make living more eco-friendly, particularly in Paris for both residents and tourists around. This not only improves the city's green credentials but also improves the tourism industry for Paris and pushes it to a more eco-conscious mentality. This is through a series of different travel aspects such as their newly introduced 'flying water taxis', otherwise known as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.seabubbles.fr/en/">SeaBubbles</a> A creation by Alain ThÃ©bault, these are super futuristic machines that use electric propulsion to glide across the water. Not only is the creation impressive as a whole, to add to this there is no sound emitted, no CO2 emissions nor is it disruptive. 
    <br>
    <br> If boats and rivers aren't quite your thing, take a cycle around the city on a pushbike or take a trip to the Louvre Museum and top up your creative levels. Paris has plenty to offer with things varyng from contemporary parks and formal floral gardens to endless corners of greenery and bucolic districts. Rich in events, there are thing to do all-year-round ranging from music festivals, film screenings, art exhibitions, gardening lessons, guided tours and other outdoor activities. Paris has so much to offer if you're looking for that city that has more than just a breath of fresh air, this is it!
